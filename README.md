## 🏛️ Main Branch Overview 🏛️

This branch models the structure of Escalation Matrix.Each department has a defined hierarchy based on seniority, starting from lower-level officers to higher-level administrators, such as the registrar, deans, and directors. 
Complaints would initially be addressed by lower-level officers and then escalated upwards if unresolved.

You can find the official information here: 👉 [Click Here](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/people/administration).

> **Note:**  
> For further details on this branch, check out **Question 3: Escalation Matrix Simulation**.  
> The necessary steps to **build**, **execute**, and learn more about this branch are available in its own `README.md` file.
